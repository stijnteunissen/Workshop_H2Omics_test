# rhdf5filters 1.16.0

## CHANGES

* rhdf5filters no longer sets the `HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable when
it is loaded.  Instead this is handled by the `H5PLprepend()` function in rhdf5.

## BUG FIXES

* Fixed issue compiling VBZ filter when R was installed via conda. Backported
to version 1.14.1.  (Reported in 
https://github.com/grimbough/rhdf5filters/issues/20)

# rhdf5filters 1.14.0

## CHANGES

* The package will now test for system libraries for several compression tools
and will use those libraries rather than compiling from source if they are
found.

# rhdf5filters 1.12.0

## USER VISIBLE CHANGES

* Compression libraries updated:
  - lz4: 1.9.2 ðŸ ª 1.9.4
* Added the standalone Zstandard filter.  The distributed version of Zstandard
is now 1.5.5.
* Added the VBZ filter.
  
## BUG FIXES

* Ensure ranlib is applied to the lzf library after it is compiled.  This 
cause linking failures on some systems.  (Thanks to 
Sergey Fedorov for the report https://github.com/grimbough/rhdf5filters/pull/18)

  proceed with default instruction sets, rather than failing to install.
